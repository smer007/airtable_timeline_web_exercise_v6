Include a README that covers:

* I did this assignment in parts, so spent around 5 hours total on the assignment.

* What you like about your implementation -
I like that the code is clean, readable, maintanable.

* What you would change if you were going to do it again.

As the user moves their mouse on the timeline, I would like to display the date(changing dynamically) on the bottom horizontal X-axis, so the user knows what date it is at any time. Currently I have it as a tooltip on the item. I would also make the handling the resizing of the screen function better.

* How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for inspiration, please note that.
I looked at google for what THE Gantt chart looks like, and decided to do something simple which WHEN the user sees, they can understand quickly what's going on.

* How you would test this if you had more time.
I would test this using react testing library.
